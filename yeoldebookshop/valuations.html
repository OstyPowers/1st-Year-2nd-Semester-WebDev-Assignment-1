		<h2>How much is your book worth?</h2>
		<div id="blurb">
			<p>The easiest way to know how much you copy of a book is worth on the open market is to pop in store. Our helpful staff can help point you in the right direction. We even offer to sell your book on your behalf.</p>
			<br>
			<p> A few things to keep in mind:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Condition means everything in a book's value. A book that has significant damage is likely not worth much. A book collector wants an attractive copy.</li>
				<br>
				<li>Dust jackets. Most hard cover books published since the early 20th century were sold with a dust jacket. The dust jacket is both the most decorative part of a book, and the most delicate. A missing dust jacket, or a dust jacket that is in poor condition, can cut a collectible book's value more than 50%, and make it harder to find a buyer.</li>
				<br>
				<li>Make sure that the copy you have matches the copy that is being offered. There are a number of ways that a book may, at first glance, look to be a rare collectible, but upon closer examination doesn't match up.</li>
				<br>
				<li>Reprint editions: Some publishers specialized in reprinting popular works in affordable reprint editions. Publishers such as Walter J. Black, Sun Dial, Triangle, Collier, A.L. Burt, and Grosset & Dunlop, to name just a few, would use the printing plates from the original publisher and reprint works long after their popularity was established. One way to check if your copy is a reprint is to compare the name of the publisher on the book's spine to the name of the publisher on the title page. Reprints will often have the original publisher's name on the pages in the book, but the book binding will identify the name of the reprint publisher.</li>
				<br>
				<li>Later printings: Publishers don't use any standardized systems for identifying a first edition. Each publisher uses their own individual system to state a first printing of a book. Even the words 'First Edition' aren't a guarantee. Publishers will sometimes forget to remove the 'First Edition' words from the printing history as they go into subsequent printings, and the number line is the only way that you can really know that your copy is a first edition.</li>
			</ul>
